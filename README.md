This is an API for cats and their missions and targets.

It uses Python, Fast API, and SQLite as a database.

First:  Create virtualenv: (if it is not create automatically by IDE)
```
virtualenv .venv
```
Activate it:
```
source .venv/bin/activate
```

Here is what packages you need to run it locally:


FAST API: 
```
pip install fastapi[all]
```

SQLAlchemy
```
pip install SQLAlchemy
```

ALEMBIC: (if you want to do the database migrations)
```
pip install alembic
```


You might need to check the data and structure of
the database via UI application.
for that install this program 
https://sqlitebrowser.org/
